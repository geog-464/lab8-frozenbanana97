						Instructions:<br><br>
						Choose this path if you are excited by tool building and the prospect of sharing ready-made functionality with your future self and others, if you enjoy programming, if you abhor redundancy and love making things efficient, modular and useful, if you understand (or plan on understanding) functions well and if you can write articulate and efficient technical documentation and instructions that are accessible to a wide audience.<br>
						<li>Right-click anywhere and click on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Open_the_Inspector" target="_blank">Inspect</a> (it may involve a different step for different web browsers). This is an extremely helpful feature of your web browser!</li>
						<li>This is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul" target="_blank">list item</a></li>
						<li>HTML elements are typically stored in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" target="_blank">divs</a></li>
						<li>Experiment with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size" target="_blank">font-size units</a> px, %, em, calc, etc.</li>
						<li>It is worth reading up on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout" target="_blank">CSS grid layout</a> since the current page is structured that way. This is relatively new to CSS and allows you to easily structure webpages without external libraries such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/css/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">Flexbox</a>, etc. CSS grid layout may appear complicated to many, so take your time with it.</li>
						<li>I will add more tips and links during the lab based on questions..</li>
						<li>Final note: you don't need to become a pro at this, but be aware that knowing the ins and outs of HTML and CSS is fundamental to basic web design. You can, however, get away with not knowing much if, for example, you are more focused on embedded webmaps, which we will get to next week and which are styled differently. Still, the bones that hold everything together are what you see right in front of you!</li>
